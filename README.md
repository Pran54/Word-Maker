The Word_Maker directory contains all the django files necessary to create a web page that produces 3 random words from the Brown University corpus.

Make sure you have nltk for python installed. See this link: http://nltk.org/install.html.

To run the django project on a local server, clone the repo, cd into the Word_Maker directory within the Word-Maker project, and then run the following command:

$ python manage.py runserver
